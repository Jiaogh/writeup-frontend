### Tech Stack

- Mostly powered by Netlify, Material UI and React.
- [Netlify](www.netlify.com) hosts writeup's static assets. Because it's amazing.
- [MaterialUI](http://material-ui.com/) - Thank you for making it easy to build presentable pages.
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - Thank you for building an awesome library to construct a web app with.
- [SlateJS](https://www.slatejs.org/#/rich-text) - The editor show casing everything.
- Create React App was used to build this.

### Design

- Design inspirations and code taken from [Material-Sense](https://alexanmtz.github.io/material-sense/)

### Code Quality

- This was written pretty quickly, so I'm not that proud of some antipatterns I used in repo. I wouldn't use it for inspiration. I'm much prouder of the backend repo than I am of the frontend.
- I'm not a frontend engineer. I'm sorry about how fast main.js grew. ... Don't judge me too hard.

### Open Sourced Backend (Mostly)

- [Python/Django Backend](https://github.com/jeffshek/open)

### File Structure

- I REALLY don't recommend any file layout / naming conventions from this frontend repo. It's still evolving and changing as I think through patterns. There are some parts I'm super embarrassed by.
